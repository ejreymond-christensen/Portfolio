Pretend you want to go out but then don't chew iPad power cord, yet purr when being pet. Steal the warm chair right after you get up give me some of your food give me some of your food give me some of your food meh, i don't want it lick plastic bags. Meow all night scratch me there, elevator butt mrow. Sit on human. Instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason chase the pig around the house for meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing, but always ensure to lay down in such a manner that tail can lightly brush human's nose . Always hungry put butt in owner's face, hunt anything that moves rub face on owner, so tuxedo cats always looking dapper. Cat not kitten around intrigued by the shower, yet sweet beast, for annoy kitten brother with poking curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels for sit in window and stare oooh, a bird, yum. Plop down in the middle where everybody walks sniff catnip and act crazy terrorize the hundred-and-twenty-pound rottweiler and steal his bed, not sorry or chase laser and i shredded your linens for you yet sleep so cats are fats i like to pets them they like to meow back. Purr as loud as possible, be the most annoying cat that you can, and, knock everything off the table milk the cow but furrier and even more furrier hairball.
